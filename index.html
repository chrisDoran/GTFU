<h1>Concept</h1>
<h2>Put on Your Sunday Clothes, There's lots of World out There</h2>
<p class="grid_6">"The average person has five social media accounts and spends around 1 hour and 40 minutes browsing these networks every day, accounting for 28pc of the total time spent on the internet."
	<br><br>
<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/11610959/Is-your-daily-social-media-usage-higher-than-average.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">-The Telegraph 2015</a>
</p>
<p class="grid_6 omega">This rather immoral experiment proved both insightful and profitable. I learned that the desperation to be included on social media is a lazy desperation. This project would seek to show people that the only reason they would pull themselves away from their screens, is to get more time to spend on their screens.</p>
<p class="grid_6">  I conducted a brief non-scientific experiment on a friend of mine while making this site. I changed his facebook password and told him that if he just stepped outside for 5 minutes I would give it back to him. Instead he paid me $2 to give it back to him. </p>

<p class="grid_6 omega"><b>GTFU</b> is all about getting people to <i> <b> get the fuck up </b> </i> from their computers and become motivated. Users of the app will have their access to certain chosen sites, such as facebook, limited or blocked completely, based on how much excersise they do. The app is less of a fitness app, and more of an AA program for people addicted to social media </p>

<h3 class="grid_6">Uses/Fuctionality</h3>

<h3 class="grid_6 omega">Style</h3>

<p class="grid_6">The App itself is very simple. It's main page is just a straight forward start and stop screen. Once started the app begins registering gps locations and steps taken. Once stopped the app uses the information to calculate the time gained for media usage. Which is displayed front and center. The other pages display data collected on disance travelled, but more importantly social media usage stats. The app is less about fitness, and more about managing a healthy relationship with social media.  </p>

<p class="grid_6 omega">The core idea I was trying to stick to throughout my entire design process was simplicity. I wanted to avoid all the faff and padding many apps come with. The apps entire function is to be concise and direct, to keep people from having to spend more time looking at a screen. Options are limited, displays are simplified and all information is presented directly.</p>

<h2 class="grid_12">Chrome Extension Mockup</h2>

<div id="test" class="grid_6"><img src="images/web-extension.png"></div>

<h3 class="grid_6 omega">Uses/Functionality</h3>
<p class="grid_6 omega">The Web extension syncs with the mobile app's information to carry over the time limit for social media across devices. In it's finished version, users will be able to select sites to block and get notifications when time is running out. In its current state, the extension simply blocks the users access to facebook completely, until the extension is disabled. So there is some need of developement there. </p>

<h1>Practical Cosiderations</h1>
<h2>Techno code stuffs</h2>
<p class="grid_6">GTFU is fairly small in its total scope. Its biggest hurdle comes in the form of connectivity between the mobile app and the desktop extension. An issue that I have seen many other apps successfully traverse. With brief research I see hope in both <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.net.httplistener%28v=vs.110%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> HttpListener</a> and <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/websockets/basics/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> sockets.</a> In terms of languages required, I think sticking to the standards of Java, JavaScript & JQuery and HTML & CSS should do the trick. I will also likely continue to you the Cool Kittens framework for the main site. </a></p>

<p class="grid_6 omega">API wise I have looked in to are <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Google Maps</a>, for the gps geolocation and <a href="https://dev.moves-app.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"> Moves</a>, a fitness pedometor API for measuring steps using mobile technology.</p>

<h2 class="grid_12" style="padding-top: 35px;">Code Experiments</h2>
<p class="grid_12 omega">For my experiments, I chose to get a semi working version of both geolocation and the site blocking extension. I used Google Maps API to allow for geolocation with acuracy on mobile devices, and general acuracy on desktops. This tech will be used to showcase the routes taken by GTFU users so they can view their progress. The extension <a href="http://chrisdoran.github.io/GTFU/Extension.zip" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">(Download Extension)</a> I created is a somewhat functioning version of what I intend to create for the project. In its current form, I have managed to get the extension to block a chosen site completely. In future I want to add in functionalty that will display a countdown that will trigger the site blocking and I would like to allow the user to choose the sites they wish to be blocked.</p>
